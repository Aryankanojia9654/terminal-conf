# My Development Command Reference

This repository is a curated collection of development commands, setup instructions, and configuration snippets that I frequently use. I created it to avoid repeatedly searching for the same commands and to ensure consistency across my development environments.

This repository covers a range of common development tasks, including:

*   **SSH Key Management:** Generating, adding, and managing SSH keys for secure remote access.
*   **Software Installations:** Step-by-step guides for installing various development tools and software packages on different operating systems.
*   **Version Control (Git):** Commonly used Git commands for managing repositories, branching, and collaborating.
*   **Environment Setup:** Configuration files and scripts for setting up development environments.
*   **Database Management:** Commands for interacting with databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
*   **And so on....**

## How to Use

The content is organized into directories based on categories (e.g., `ssh`, `install`, `git`). Each directory contains Markdown files with detailed instructions and examples.

Example: To find instructions on generating an SSH key, navigate to the `ssh` directory and open the relevant Markdown file.
